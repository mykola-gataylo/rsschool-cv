# Mykola Gataylo

## Junior Front-end Developer

Hello!
My names is Mykola and I want to radically change my life and start working as a front-end developer.
At this stage, I am finishing the RS School courses in JavaScript / Front-end and at the same time I am looking for an interesting team and no less interesting projects, where I can put the acquired skills into practice.
I am always ready to learn new skills as well as polish existing technical and soft skills.
